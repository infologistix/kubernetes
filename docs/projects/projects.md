  <summary>Peak load forecasting in the energy market</summary>
  <div>
    <div><p>Load peaks occur in many networked systems, such as data centers, logistics or power grids. In the case of internal power grids, load peaks result in disproportionately high costs, since either excess capacities have to be maintained or services have to be purchased externally.
    Using AI-based methods, energy load peaks (which cost a lot of money) are automatically predicted and intercepted via adapted production control. This is done by machine learning, which is used to create transparency about the max. daily load withdrawals. The fine control (management) of the decisive energy consumers can thus be optimized.</p>
    <p><b>Conclusion:</b> Especially medium-sized industrial companies can significantly reduce their energy costs with this lightweight AI solution - quickly, easily and safely.</p>
