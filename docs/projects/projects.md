  <summary>Docker without desktop</summary>
  <div>
    <div>Docker Desktop becomes commercial, we show you a free alternative - Docker in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
    Docker's free products are used by millions of developers to build, publish and run applications - in data centers, the public cloud or with Docker Desktop on the local PC. 
    55% of developers use Docker every day at work. <a style={{color:"#6CA8B7"}} href="../blog/docker-in-wsl">Read more</a></div>

  <summary>Peak load forecasting in the energy market</summary>
  <div>
    <div><p>Load peaks occur in many networked systems, such as data centers, logistics or power grids. In the case of internal power grids, load peaks result in disproportionately high costs, since either excess capacities have to be maintained or services have to be purchased externally.
    Using AI-based methods, energy load peaks (which cost a lot of money) are automatically predicted and intercepted via adapted production control. This is done by machine learning, which is used to create transparency about the max. daily load withdrawals. The fine control (management) of the decisive energy consumers can thus be optimized.</p>
    <p><b>Conclusion:</b> Especially medium-sized industrial companies can significantly reduce their energy costs with this lightweight AI solution - quickly, easily and safely.</p>

  <summary>Skill database</summary>
  <div>
    <div>A web application where users can enter their technical skills. This information is sent from the frontend to the backend and from there to the graph database "Neo4j". Afterwards, the aggregated data/user information can be viewed in the Shopify format. The goal of this application is to be able to assign suitable employees to projects/project tenders as quickly as possible and to have contact persons for individual technologies.</div>
