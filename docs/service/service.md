<h3>Platform Engineering</h3>

Platform engineering is the behind-the-scenes work that makes all the technology and digital services we use possible. It involves creating and maintaining the systems, tools, and infrastructure that support various software applications and websites.

Imagine a platform as a big, interconnected structure that allows different software programs to work together smoothly, just like a complex network of roads and highways. Platform engineers are like the skilled architects and builders who design and construct this digital infrastructure.

They ensure that the servers, networks, and databases that power our digital world are reliable, secure, and efficient. They also develop software tools and processes that enable different applications to communicate and share information with each other

<h3>Private + Public Cloud</h3> 

Private and public clouds are two different ways of using and accessing computer resources and services over the internet.

<summary>More explanantion</summary>
A private cloud is like having your own personal space in the digital world. It involves setting up a dedicated infrastructure, like servers and storage systems, that is exclusively used by a single organization or individual. It provides more control and security because only authorized people can access and manage the resources in the private cloud. It's like having your own private garden where you can control who enters and what you grow.

On the other hand, a public cloud is like a shared space where many people and organizations can access and use computer resources. It is provided by companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, who have built huge infrastructures to host and manage these resources. The public cloud allows individuals and businesses to use computing power, storage, and software applications on a pay-as-you-go basis. It's like living in an apartment building where you share the common areas with other people.

In summary, a private cloud is a dedicated and controlled digital space, while a public cloud is a shared and accessible space where resources are provided by a third-party company. Both private and public clouds have their own advantages and are used by individuals and organizations depending on their specific needs and preferences.

<h3>Software Engineering + AI</h3> 

In recent years, AI has become an important aspect of software engineering. AI technologies are being integrated into various software applications to enhance their capabilities, such as voice assistants, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles. So, while software engineering focuses on creating software applications, AI adds an extra layer of intelligence and adaptability to these applications, making them more powerful and efficient.

<details style={{backgroundColor:"#F8F8FF55", border: "1px solid #F8F8FF55", color:"white"}}>
<summary>More explanantion</summary>
Software engineering is the process of designing, creating, and maintaining computer programs or software applications. It involves using programming languages and various tools to write code and build software that can perform specific tasks or solve problems.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing images, or making decisions. AI involves creating algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data, adapt, and make predictions or decisions.
